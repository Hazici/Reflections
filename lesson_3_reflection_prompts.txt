When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

	It is also a backup, and makes development machine-independent.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	An interaction with that branch can cause problems, I cannot be sure is I'm dealing with the right commit.	

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

	Fork is GitHub internal option, cloning is obtaining a repository, a branch is a "path" within a repo.
