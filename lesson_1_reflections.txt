How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    Indicating content that has been changed, rather than manual compare.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    Find bug in minutes innstead of hours.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Pro: Code is complete, possibly compile
    Con: If you forget to save/commit, you can lose work.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Those file belongs to each other, one update makes changes in all of those.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log shows commits, and able to graph
    git diff show differences between two commits

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    I can switch back to working copy any time

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    Study from other people's code first, like machine learning :)
